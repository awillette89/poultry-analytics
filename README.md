## Overview

- This project analyzes egg production and price trends in the United States from 2016 to 2021.
- It uncovers patterns, seasonal variations, and correlations between production volumes and market prices.
- Users can explore data in `chickens.ipynb` with data cleaning, feature engineering, visualizations, and poultry industry insights.
- No coding knowledge is needed to follow notebook explanations, but a Python environment is required to run code.

### Technologies Used

- **Pandas**: Pandas loads, cleans, and manipulates datasets, handles missing values, and creates features.
- **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib generates visualizations like line plots for price trends and bar charts for state production.
- **SQLite3**: SQLite3 stores cleaned data in a database and enables SQL queries for retrieval and joins.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook presents code, comments, and observations in a narrative format.


# Project Objective

- This project investigates the relationship between egg production volumes and market prices across the US from 2016 to 2021.
- **Guiding questions**: What are the seasonal trends in egg production and prices? Which states produce the most eggs?
- **Insight goal**: Uncover trends to inform poultry industry stakeholders on pricing strategies and production planning.

# Data Source

- Data is sourced from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Quick Stats database.

# Data Summary

- The egg prices dataset contains 72 rows of monthly US national egg prices from January 2016 to December 2021.
- The average all utilization price is approximately 0.90 $/dozen (minimum: 0.483, maximum: 1.89).
- The average table egg price is approximately 0.66 $/dozen (minimum: 0.197, maximum: 1.81).
- Data types include floats for prices and strings for categorical fields.
- The egg production dataset includes 8,212 rows of state-level monthly production from 2016 to 2021.
- After cleaning, 2,518 rows remain, focusing on production in dozens with undisclosed "(d)" values removed.
- The dataset features quantitative production metrics and qualitative location details for regional trends.
- **Note on missing data**: Some states may appear underrepresented due to "(d)" values. These were removed for accuracy, which may affect completeness. See the notebookâ€™s cleaning steps for details.
- Details are available in `chickens.ipynb`, where data is loaded and explored.
